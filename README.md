# Powershell-Excel-CSV-Breakout
Splits up excel/csv documents based on a value in a column

Ex. If column is named "Location" and Value in the column for each line is a state "KS", "MO" 

Then when ran on the Location column, will breakout to smaller csv files with corresponding data named the column data Ex. "KS.csv" "MO.csv"

Current does not have variables to change file name or location but that could be easily added.
